What is discrete mathematics? Discrete mathematics is the part of mathematics devoted to
the study of discrete objects. (Here discrete means consisting of distinct or unconnected
elements.) The kinds of problems solved using discrete mathematics include:
 How many ways are there to choose a valid password on a computer system?
 What is the probability of winning a lottery?
 Is there a link between two computers in a network?
 How can I identify spam e-mail messages?
 How can I encrypt a message so that no unintended recipient can read it?
 What is the shortest path between two cities using a transportation system?
 How can a list of integers be sorted so that the integers are in increasing order?
 How many steps are required to do such a sorting?
 How can it be proved that a sorting algorithm correctly sorts a list?
 How can a circuit that adds two integers be designed?
 How many valid Internet addresses are there?
You will learn the discrete structures and techniques needed to solve problems such as these.
More generally, discrete mathematics is used whenever objects are counted, when relationships
between finite (or countable) sets are studied, and when processes involving a finite number
of steps are analyzed. A key reason for the growth in the importance of discrete mathematics is
that information is stored and manipulated by computing machines in a discrete fashion.
WHY STUDY DISCRETE MATHEMATICS? There are several important reasons for
studying discrete mathematics. First, through this course you can develop your mathematical
maturity: that is, your ability to understand and create mathematical arguments.You will not get
very far in your studies in the mathematical sciences without these skills.
Second, discrete mathematics is the gateway to more advanced courses in all parts of
the mathematical sciences. Discrete mathematics provides the mathematical foundations for
many computer science courses including data structures, algorithms, database theory, automata
theory, formal languages, compiler theory, computer security, and operating systems. Students
find these courses much more difficult when they have not had the appropriate mathematical
foundations from discrete math. One student has sent me an e-mail message saying that she
used the contents of this book in every computer science course she took!
Math courses based on the material studied in discrete mathematics include logic, set theory,
number theory, linear algebra, abstract algebra, combinatorics, graph theory, and probability
theory (the discrete part of the subject).
Also, discrete mathematics contains the necessary mathematical background for solving
problems in operations research (including many discrete optimization techniques), chemistry,
engineering, biology, and so on. In the text, we will study applications to some of these areas.
Many students find their introductory discrete mathematics course to be significantly more
challenging than courses they have previously taken. One reason for this is that one of the
primary goals of this course is to teach mathematical reasoning and problem solving, rather
than a discrete set of skills. The exercises in this book are designed to reflect this goal. Although
there are plenty of exercises in this text similar to those addressed in the examples, a large
percentage of the exercises require original thought. This is intentional. The material discussed
in the text provides the tools needed to solve these exercises, but your job is to successfully
apply these tools using your own creativity. One of the primary goals of this course is to learn
how to attack problems that may be somewhat different from any you may have previously
seen. Unfortunately, learning how to solve only particular types of exercises is not sufficient for
success in developing the problem-solving skills needed in subsequent courses and professional
work. This text addresses many different topics, but discrete mathematics is an extremely diverse
and large area of study. One of my goals as an author is to help you develop the skills needed
to master the additional material you will need in your own future pursuits.
THE EXERCISES I would like to offer some advice about how you can best learn discrete
mathematics (and other subjects in the mathematical and computing sciences).You will learn the
most by actively working exercises. I suggest that you solve as many as you possibly can. After
working the exercises your instructor has assigned, I encourage you to solve additional exercises
such as those in the exercise sets following each section of the text and in the supplementary
exercises at the end of each chapter. (Note the key explaining the markings preceding exercises.)
Key to the Exercises
no marking A routine exercise
∗ A difficult exercise
∗∗ An extremely challenging exercise
An exercise containing a result used in the book (Table 1 on the
following page shows where these exercises are used.)
(Requires calculus ) An exercise whose solution requires the use of limits or concepts
from differential or integral calculus
The best approach is to try exercises yourself before you consult the answer section at the
end of this book. Note that the odd-numbered exercise answers provided in the text are answers
only and not full solutions; in particular, the reasoning required to obtain answers is omitted in
these answers. The Student’s Solutions Guide, available separately, provides complete, worked
solutions to all odd-numbered exercises in this text. When you hit an impasse trying to solve an
odd-numbered exercise, I suggest you consult the Student’s Solutions Guide and look for some
guidance as to how to solve the problem. The more work you do yourself rather than passively
reading or copying solutions, the more you will learn. The answers and solutions to the evennumbered
exercises are intentionally not available from the publisher; ask your instructor if you
have trouble with these.
WEB RESOURCES You are strongly encouraged to take advantage of additional resources
available on the Web, especially those on the companion website for this book found
at www.mhhe.com/rosen.You will find many Extra Examples designed to clarify key concepts;
Self Assessments for gauging how well you understand core topics; Interactive Demonstration
Applets exploring key algorithms and other concepts; a Web Resources Guide containing an
extensive selection of links to external sites relevant to the world of discrete mathematics; extra
explanations and practice to help you master core concepts; added instruction on writing proofs
and on avoiding common mistakes in discrete mathematics; in-depth discussions of important
applications; and guidance on utilizing MapleTM software to explore the computational aspects
of discrete mathematics. Places in the text where these additional online resources are available
are identified in the margins by special icons. You will also find (after fall 2012) the Virtual
Discrete Mathematics Tutor, an on-line resource that provides extra support to help you make
the transition from lower level courses to discrete mathematics. This tutorial should help answer
many of your questions and correct errors that you may make, based on errors other students
using this book, have made. For more details on these and other online resources, see the
description of the companion website immediately preceding this “To the Student” message.

THE VALUE OF THIS BOOK My intention is to make your substantial investment in
this text an excellent value. The book, the associated ancillaries, and companion website have
taken many years of effort to develop and refine. I am confident that most of you will find that
the text and associated materials will help you master discrete mathematics, just as so many
previous students have. Even though it is likely that you will not cover some chapters in your
current course, you should find it helpful—as many other students have—to read the relevant
sections of the book as you take additional courses. Most of you will return to this book as a
useful tool throughout your future studies, especially for those of you who continue in computer
science, mathematics, and engineering. I have designed this book to be a gateway for future
studies and explorations, and to be comprehensive reference, and I wish you luck as you begin
your journey.
