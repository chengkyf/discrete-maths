This text has been carefully written and constructed to support discrete mathematics courses
at several levels and with differing foci. The following table identifies the core and optional
sections. An introductory one-term course in discrete mathematics at the sophomore level can
be based on the core sections of the text, with other sections covered at the discretion of the
instructor. A two-term introductory course can include all the optional mathematics sections in
addition to the core sections. A course with a strong computer science emphasis can be taught
by covering some or all of the optional computer science sections. Instructors can find sample
syllabi for a wide range of discrete mathematics courses and teaching suggestions for using each
section of the text can be found in the Instructor’s Resource Guide available on the website for
this book.

Instructors using this book can adjust the level of difficulty of their course by choosing
either to cover or to omit the more challenging examples at the end of sections, as well as
the more challenging exercises. The chapter dependency chart shown here displays the strong
dependencies.A star indicates that only relevant sections of the chapter are needed for study of a
later chapter.Weak dependencies have been ignored. More details can be found in the Instructor
Resource Guide.
